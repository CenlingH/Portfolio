# Hi, I'm Yiran Hu

![Yiran Hu](assets/Yiran Hu.jpg){width=300px}

I am a graduate student in **Systems Engineering** with a background in
**Computer Science and data analysis**.

❤️ I work at the intersection of **data science and computer programming**,
and I enjoy taking on a wide range of problems rather than staying within
a single discipline. I am motivated by curiosity and enjoy learning from
different industries and people, as I believe this breadth helps me build
stronger judgment and opens up more possibilities for my future work.

- **Data analysis & visualization** — transforming complex datasets into clear, actionable insights (Python, Tableau)
- **Applied research & computational modeling** — translating scientific and technical concepts into working systems (simulation, ECG)
- **Web development & content systems** — building and maintaining real-world websites with sustainable content workflows (WordPress, HTML/CSS)
- **Machine learning & data analysis** — exploring models to identify patterns and risk signals in large-scale data
- **Technical communication & storytelling** — presenting technical work clearly to non-technical audiences through visuals and narrative
- **Human-centered design & accessibility** — designing usable, inclusive interfaces grounded in real user needs (Figma, HCI)
