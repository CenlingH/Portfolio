UIUC Student Data Analysis & Tableau Dashboard - ATLAS Internship in UIUC\n\n**Tools:** Python, Tableau  \n**Type:** Data Analytics Internship\n\n### 🧭 Overview\nThis project focuses on analyzing **UIUC student datasets** to uncover\npatterns related to **academic performance and student outcomes**. The goal was not only to analyze the data and find students at risk of dropping out, but to translate complex academic\ninformation into clear, interactive visual insights that can be understood by both technical and non-technical audiences.\n\n### 🔍 What I Did\n- **Cleaned and validated institutional student data**, ensuring consistency across academic records  \n- Researched and analyzed key academic indicators such as **GPA, academic standing, social economic status, and geographic attributes** that may influence student success\n- Explored patterns in unfinished students and academic risk levels through exploratory analysis  \n- Built **interactive Tableau dashboards** to allow users to explore trends and compare student outcomes dynamically  \n\n### 📊 Key Insights\n- Student academic outcomes exhibit **clear geographic disparities** across regions\n- Students from areas with **less access to educational resources** show a **higher proportion of unfinished enrollment**\n- These regions also contain a **larger share of students in poor academic standing**, including probation-level status\n- The coexistence of **unfinished enrollment** and **academic risk** suggests that structural and regional factors may play an important role in student performance\n\n\n### 🎯 Why This Project Matters\nRather than presenting static charts, this project emphasizes  **data storytelling and clarity**.\n\nBy allowing users to interact with the dashboard, researchers and educators can:\n- Explore academic patterns independently across different student groups  \n- **Identify students who may be at potential academic risk and require additional attention**  \n- Better understand how multiple factors relate to student progress and outcomes\n\n\n### 🔗 Output\n- 👉 **Interactive Tableau Dashboard:**  \n  **[View on Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/yiran.hu5618/viz/Book2_17211120709020/Dashboard1)**\n\n![Geographic distribution of student academic status and unfinished enrollment across regions.](assets/uiuc_tableau_map.png)\n\n---\n\n## 2. Web Development – Community Service Center of Northern Champaign County\n\n**Tools:** WordPress, HTML, CSS   \n**Type:** Web Development Internship\n\n### 🧭 Overview\nRedesigned and improved a community service organization’s website to make\nkey resources easier to find and to support a broader audience with bilingual content.\nThe focus was on **real-world usability**: helping visitors quickly locate services,\nlearn how to volunteer, and complete donations with fewer steps.\n\n### 🔧 What I Delivered\n- **Rebuilt the site structure and navigation**, reorganizing content so visitors can easily locate\n  key information such as services, events, and volunteering opportunities  \n- Redesigned and updated core pages, including **Service** and **Volunteer** sections, to improve clarity and usability  \n- Implemented a **bilingual language experience (English / Spanish)** and maintained content consistency across both versions  \n- **Created and maintained an interactive event calendar**, enabling staff to freely add, edit, and remove events  \n- Designed **event pop-up interactions** that display event details on hover, improving event discoverability  \n- Regularly **updated event content and media**, including adding new activities, descriptions, and photos to keep the site current  \n\n\n### ✅ Impact\n- Improved **information accessibility** for diverse community members, including bilingual audiences  \n- Increased visibility of **community events and activities** through a clear, regularly updated event calendar  \n- Delivered a more **consistent and maintainable website structure** to support ongoing content updates\n\n\n\n### 🔗 Output\n- **Archived version of the live production website:**  \n  [View via Internet Archive](https://web.archive.org/web/20241203104559/https://cscrantoul.org/)\n\n> *Note:* The website has since been updated and maintained by other contributors after my internship.  \n> This archived version reflects the site structure and content during my contribution period.  \n> Some dynamic elements (e.g., event calendar interactions or gallery images) may not fully load due to archiving limitations.\n\n**Event page (captured during normal operation):**\n\n![Event calendar page with interactive event details and hover pop-ups.](assets/web development event calendar.png)\n\n---\n\n## 3. QuickPlate – Food Recipe Mobile App (HCI Design Project)\n\n**Tools:** Figma  \n**Type:** UX / UI Design · Human-Computer Interaction\n\n\n### 🧭 Overview\nQuickPlate is a mobile recipe application designed to help users quickly find\nmeals that match their **time constraints, budget, dietary preferences, and\navailable ingredients**.  \nThe project focuses on **reducing the cognitive and emotional burden of meal\nplanning**, especially for busy students and individuals with limited time.\n\n\n### 👤 User Problem & Use Cases\nThis app was designed around realistic, everyday scenarios, such as:\n- A student returning home after work who wants to cook using **only the ingredients already available**\n- Users with **limited time** who need recipes filtered by total cooking time\n- Individuals looking to **explore new dishes** without complicated preparation steps\n\nQuickPlate addresses these needs by allowing users to filter recipes by\n**ingredients, cooking time, cost, time of day, and dietary preferences**\n(e.g., vegetarian or vegan).\n\n\n\n### 🧩 Design Process\n- Conducted analysis of existing recipe apps to identify gaps in usability and feature focus  \n- Prioritized **simplicity and quick decision-making** over excessive recipe complexity  \n- Designed user flows that support:\n  - Saving and editing personal recipes  \n  - Generating a **combined ingredient list** that functions as a shopping list  \n  - Tracking cooked meals and favorited recipes through a user profile  \n\n\n\n### ♿ Accessibility & Inclusive Design\nAccessibility was a core consideration throughout the design:  \n- **Mobility impairments:** Large buttons, simplified interactions, and layouts optimized for one-handed use  \n- **Cognitive accessibility:** Consistent layouts, clear iconography, and reduced visual clutter to lower cognitive load  \n- **Neurodiversity & mental health:** Calm color palette, no flashing elements, and predictable navigation to reduce stress and anxiety  \nThese choices were made to ensure the app is usable, welcoming, and easy to learn for a wide range of users.\n\n\n\n### 🎯 Outcome\nThe final Figma prototype demonstrates:\n- A complete end-to-end user flow from recipe discovery to meal tracking  \n- Clear information hierarchy and intuitive navigation  \n- A design that balances **functionality, accessibility, and visual clarity**\n\n\n### 🔗 Output\n- 👉 **Interactive Figma Prototype:**  \n  **[View
