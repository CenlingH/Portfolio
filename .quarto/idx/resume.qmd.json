stakeholders**, translating statistical outcomes into actionable insights for early intervention strategies and future research direction.\n\n---\n\n### Trading Capture System -- Execution Engine\n**Tools:** Java, MySQL  \nPhiladelphia, PA | Aug 2025 – Present\n\n- Developed core backend services in **Java** for a transaction capture and execution pipeline, supporting data integrity, correctness, and operational reliability.\n- Designed and managed **MySQL** and MongoDB data stores to handle high-volume records, emphasizing schema consistency, data quality, and query reliability.\n- Contributed to an iterative development workflow using **Git** and **Maven**, incorporating testing, code reviews, and incremental improvements to enhance **system maintainability and stability**.\n\n\n---\n\n### QuickPlate – Food Recipe Mobile App (HCI Design Project)  \n**Tools:** Figma  \nChampaign, IL | Jan 2024 – May 2024\n\n- Designed a mobile recipe app prototype to help users find meals based on **time, cost, dietary preferences, and available ingredients**\n- Conducted thorough analysis of existing recipe apps to inform feature selection and usability decisions\n- Created end-to-end user flows including recipe discovery, shopping lists, and user profiles\n- Integrated **accessibility considerations**, such as large touch targets, consistent layouts, and reduced cognitive load\n\n\n---\n\n\n## 📖 research Experience\n\n### 3D Heart Electrophysiology Simulation  \n**Research Assistant**  \nShanghai, China | Nov 2024 – Jun 2025\n\n- Built a **GPU-accelerated 3D cardiac electrophysiology simulator** in **C/CUDA**, modeling large-scale myocardial grids and parallelizing cell-state updates for high-resolution simulations.\n- Extended a **cellular automata framework** to explicitly model **depolarization and repolarization**, redesigning state-transition rules and calibrating timing parameters to better reflect physiological behavior.\n- Analyzed electrical conduction and propagation pathways across atria, ventricles, and the conduction system, examining how activation timing and conduction delays shape characteristic ECG waveforms.\n- Implemented **full 12-lead ECG computation** and an **end-to-end simulation workflow**, supporting pacemaker stimulation and arrhythmia scenarios (e.g., **PVC**, **atrial flutter**) with visualization for analysis.\n\n\n---\n\n## 🌱 Extracurricular Experience\n\n### Event Management Volunteer  \n**China Thinks Big National Forum**  \nShanghai, China | Feb 2025 – Mar 2025\n\n- Supported on-site operations for a national academic forum with **1,900+ students, faculty, and guests**\n- Hosted high school paper presentation and defense sessions, coordinating judges and managing time flow\n-
